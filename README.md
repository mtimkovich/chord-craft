# Chordcraft

Chordcraft is a project I'm working on to assist with understanding chords and chord progressions.

Right now it has 2 features:
- Calculate Roman numeral notation for a chord progression
- Printing the notes of given chords

Sample input files are in the `samples/` directory.

## Usage
```
usage: main.py [-h] [input] {progression,prog,p,chords,c} ...

positional arguments:
  input                 chord input
  {progression,prog,p,chords,c}
    progression (prog, p)
                        Output chord progression
    chords (c)          Print notes of chords

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```
